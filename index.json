Farmer is commercially supported, open source and free-to-use.\nFor those of you working with Azure today, you may already be aware that one of the most useful features is the ability to generate entire infrastructure architectures as code via ARM Template files. These templates contain a declarative model that allows repeatable deployments and idempotent releases (among other things).\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s wrong with ARM? Unfortunately, ARM templates have some limitations caused by the fact that they must be authored in a verbose JSON dialect:\n They provide very limited type checking and support, which makes creating discovery and creation of template features difficult. Templates need a lot of boilerplate to be created for even relatively simple and common resources. It requires \u0026ldquo;embedded\u0026rdquo;, difficult-to-maintain stringly-typed code in order to achieve what might be trivial in a \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; programming language, such as references, variables and parameters - or writing elements such as loops. The documentation for ARM templates is not always kept up-to-date, so understanding and learning how to properly use them can involve a lot of searching and trial-and-error.  In other words, whilst working with ARM templates that have already been created is relatively straightforward, the authoring of the templates themselves is time-consuming and error-prone.\nWhilst there have been some recent improvements to ARM - including tooling improvements in VS Code through an extension - we think that we can do much better than relying on tooling for a specific IDE, which means using something different than JSON when directly authoring ARM templates.\nWhat does Farmer do to fix this? Farmer templates are simple .NET Core applications which reference the Farmer NuGet package. This package contains a set of types that model Azure resources in a strongly-typed and succinct fashion, as well as functionality to create ARM templates from this model - and even deploy directly to Azure.\nWhat can I use Farmer for?

Farmer has limited support for parameters and no support for variables, so we will not cover them.\nSo a generated ARM Template from Farmer will have the following structure.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;contentVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;outputs\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [] } When building a new resource in Farmer you are providing the means for a user of Farmer to generate a new resource type, or configure a new property on an existing resource. These resources are added by Farmer to the resources array you can see above.\nWhen building up a resource it will have a schema that looks something like this.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-example-resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;westeurope\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;sku\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;S1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;adminUserEnabled\u0026#34;: true, }, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [] } Your resource you create will have a type of service that it represents. Each service has many versions, represented by a date. Typically your builder will at first focus on adding properties to the properties field to configure a service to be deployed in a certain state.\nWhere can I find docs on ARM templates schemas themselves? There are three good sources to learning about specific ARM resources and what parts need to be used in creating an equivalent Farmer resource:\n Reference Docs: The reference documentation contains details on the schema for every resource and every version e.g. Container Registry reference. Sample Template: The Azure Quickstart Templates github repository contains many examples of real-world ARM templates e.g. Container Registry with Geo Replication sample. Reverse engineer: You can manually create a required resource in Azure, and then use Azure\u0026rsquo;s export ARM template functionality to create an ARM template. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you test out the exported template yourself before porting it to Farmer, because Azure sometimes exports invalid templates!

ARM expressions can also contain a set of predefined functions supported by the ARM runtime.

To manipulate such values, you can use standard F# and .NET capabilities.\n How do I use ARM expressions? Many Farmer builders contain pre-defined ARM expression that can be used for common tasks, such as passing a connection string from a storage account as a KeyVault secret, or a web application setting.\nAs an example, a Storage Account config contains a Key member that you can supply this to a web app as a setting:\nlet storageConfig = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;myStorageAccount\u0026#34; } let webAppConfig = webApp { name \u0026#34;myWebApp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34; storageConfig.Key } This will be written to the ARM template file as follows:\n\u0026#34;appSettings\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[concat(\u0026#39;DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myStorageAccount;AccountKey=\u0026#39;, listKeys(\u0026#39;myStorageAccount\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2017-10-01\u0026#39;).keys[0].value)]\u0026#34; } Using ARM expressions means that you can deploy an application which is automatically configured at deployment time. This means that you never need to store an application secret such as a storage account key in source control, or even e.g. as a secret variable in your build / deployment process.\nReturning the value of ARM Expressions as outputs. ARM Expressions can also be passed back as outputs and used further downstream once your deployment is complete:\nlet template = arm { location Location.WestEurope add_resource storageConfig // Mark the storage_key as an output in the ARM template.  output \u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34; storageConfig.Key } // Deploy the template. let outputs = template |\u0026gt; Deploy.execute template [] // Get the value of the storage_key. let key = outputs.[\u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34;] Be aware though, that the value of the storage_key is visible as a plain text value in the output - so anyone with access to, for example, the Azure portal will be able to see the values of the storage key if they look at the deployment history.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/parameters/","title":"Parameters and Variables","tags":[],"description":"","content":"ARM templates support the idea both of parameterisation of templates and of the use of variables within a template for e.g. placeholders and re-using values.\nFarmer, by design, has only limited support for parameters and no support for variables.

ARM templates also allow the use of a custom set of a commands which are embedded within strings to generate program logic, using expressions which contain template functions.

This record should use types as required to capture e.g. SKUs or other elements that would benefit from typing (in the example above, sku is a string, but we will shortly replace that with a union type).\n Try to avoid going too far - the implementation of JsonModel should, more or less, be a copying of fields across and adding in some extra boilerplate around the type field etc. Feel free to use member properties to capture values that are \u0026ldquo;derived\u0026rdquo; from other ones.\n // src/Farmer/Arm/ContainerRegistry.fs [\u0026lt;AutoOpen\u0026gt;] module Farmer.Arm.ContainerRegistry open Farmer // Temporarily define the SKU and other types alongside the IArmResource. type Sku = | Basic | Standard | Premium type Registries = { Name : ResourceName Location : Location Sku : Sku AdminUserEnabled : bool } interface IArmResource with member this.ResourceName = this.Name member this.JsonModel = {| name = this.Name.Value ``type`` = \u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34; apiVersion = \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34; sku = {| name = this.Sku.ToString() |} location = this.Location.ArmValue tags = {||} properties = {| adminUserEnabled = this.AdminUserEnabled |} |} :\u0026gt; _ Notice how we perform simple \u0026ldquo;serialization\u0026rdquo; of elements such as the SKU, but otherwise most fields are copies across.\nStep 2.2: Move domain types out of the IArmBuilder. For now, we\u0026rsquo;ve created any associated types such as Sku directly above the file, but you\u0026rsquo;ll want to migrate these to a Farmer.ContainerRegistry module in Common.fs afterwards e.g.\n// src/Farmer/Common.fs namespace Farmer module ContainerRegistry = type Sku = | Basic | Standard | Premium You can test this again easily by passing an instance into a Farmer deployment like we did in the previous step:\nopen Farmer.Arm.ContainerRegistry let registries = { Name = ResourceName \u0026#34;my-registry\u0026#34; Location = Location.WestEurope Sku = ContainerRegistry.Basic AdminUserEnabled = true } let deployment = arm { location Location.NorthEurope add_resource registries } deployment |\u0026gt; Writer.quickWrite \u0026#34;output\u0026#34; Note that F# records must be completely filled, so you must provide values for all four fields.\nAlternatively, you could now write a test to assert the Json structure. Most tests in the project though tend to test from the Farmer builders, which we will get to soon. You can stop right here if you want - what you\u0026rsquo;ve done so far allows you to create IArmResource objects which can be added to the Farmer pipeline.

However, much of this work is done for you since Farmer creates multiple resources for you at the builder level, and will ensure that the appropriate dependencies are set for you - for example, when creating a SQL Azure instance, Farmer will automatically ensure that the database depends on the server.\nHowever, you will still need to set dependencies when you have a relationship between builders, such as setting the key of a storage account on a web app.\nSetting dependencies Setting a dependency requires you to call the depends_on keyword on the target resource, providing a handle to the dependent resources.\nlet myStorage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;sampleaccount\u0026#34; } let myApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34; myStorage.Key depends_on [ myStorage ] } or resources if we have many of them.\nlet myStorage1 = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;sampleaccountFirst\u0026#34; } let myStorage2 = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;sampleaccountSecond\u0026#34; } let myApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storage_key\u0026#34; myStorage.Key depends_on [ myStorage1.Name.ResourceName; myStorage2.Name.ResourceName ] } Here, we set up a dependency on myApp for myStorage.

Type safety: Where possible, use F#\u0026lsquo;s type system to make it impossible to create invalid templates. Flexibility: Provide users with the ability to override the defaults where needed.  Farmer Resources Farmer works on a simple, consistent process:\n You create Farmer resources, such as Storage Accounts and Web Apps. Each Farmer resource can represent one or many ARM resources. For example, a Farmer webApp resource represents both the Microsoft.Web/sites and Microsoft.Web/serverfarms resources. In addition, it optionally also provides simplified access to an Microsoft.Insights/components. You configure each resource using simple, human-readable custom keywords in a strongly-typed environment. You link together resources as required. Once you have created all resources, you bundle them up together into an ARM deployment resource. You then generate (and optionally deploy) an ARM template. The rest of your deployment pipeline stays the same.  The diagram below illustrates how Farmer resources map to ARM ones:\ngraph TD subgraph ARM Template classDef danger fill:orange; C(Microsoft.Web/serverfarms) -. dependency .-F D(Microsoft.Insights/components) -. dependency .-F E(Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts) -. dependency .-F E -. storage key .- F E -. storage key .- G F(Microsoft.Web/sites) G(blobServices/containers) class C danger class D danger class E danger class F danger class G danger end subgraph Farmer A(webApp)-. depends on .-B B(storageAccount)-. key .-A end  In this example, we create a storage account and web app in Farmer, which maps five different ARM template resources. As you can see, resources in Farmer are declared at a higher level of abstraction than ARM template resources. This makes things much simpler to reason about, and quicker to author.\nAn example Farmer Resource All Farmer resources follow the same approach:\n You define a resource using a special \u0026ldquo;builder\u0026rdquo; that allows the use of custom keywords. This is known as an F# computation expression. Each builder is designed for a specific type of Azure resource e.g. websites, functions, virtual machines etc., and each has defaults set for the most common scenario. This resource is validated and converted into a Farmer configuration object, which contains the configuration for that resource including any defaults. This configuration is then added to an overarching Farmer ARM deployment object. The ARM deployment object is converted into an ARM template json file.  graph LR subgraph JSON C(ARM Template) end subgraph .NET A(Farmer Builder)--validation and defaults --B B(Farmer Configuration) --emitted to -- C end  Here\u0026rsquo;s an example web application.\nlet myWebApp = webApp { name \u0026#34;mystorage\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;myKey\u0026#34; \u0026#34;aValue\u0026#34; sku Sku.B1 always_on app_insights_off worker_size WorkerSize.Medium number_of_workers 3 run_from_package }  The webApp { } builder defines the start and end of the definition of the web application. Within this builder, you use custom keywords to configure the web app, such as name and setting. Some keywords take arguments, but others e.g. always_on are simple declarative markers.   You can view details of all farmer resources in the resource guide.\n Putting it all together The diagram above can be shown in code as follows:\n/// An Azure Storage account with a container. let storage = storageAccount { name \u0026#34;astorageaccount\u0026#34; add_public_container \u0026#34;myContainer\u0026#34; } /// An Azure App Service with built-in App Insights. let app = webApp { name \u0026#34;awebapp\u0026#34; setting \u0026#34;storageKey\u0026#34; storage.Key // pull in the storage key to an app setting  depends_on storage // state that this web app depends on the storage account } /// An ARM deployment with both of the above resources attached let deployment = arm { location Location.NorthEurope add_resource storage add_resource app } // Write the ARM template out to myTemplate.json let filename = deployment.Template |\u0026gt; Writer.toJson |\u0026gt; Writer.toFile \u0026#34;myTemplate\u0026#34; "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/quickstarts/quickstart-3/","title":"Deploying to Azure","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Introduction In this exercise, you\u0026rsquo;ll update the application to deploy the generated ARM template to Azure directly from Farmer.\n Farmer generates normal ARM templates.

In such cases, we\nAn IBuilder is not only even easier to consume by users than the F# record above, but can create multiple IArmResource objects at once. This is especially useful for more complex resources that tend to come in groups of two or three together - for example, Server Farm and Web Apps, or Cosmos DB Accounts, Databases and Containers. An IBuilder encapsulates the logic needed to create and configure all the resources together.\n In this example, the Container Registry builder only creates a single resource.\n Step 3.1: The Configuration Record The first step is to create a simple configuration record that contains any data that is required to be captured by the user. Often, this may map nearly 1:1 with the IArmResource - normally the main difference will be that you do not need to provide the Location here, as Farmer will automatically provide that for you.\n// src/Farmer/Builders.ContainerRegistry.fs type ContainerRegistryConfig = { Name : ResourceName Sku : Sku AdminUserEnabled : bool } interface IBuilder with member this.DependencyName = this.Name member this.BuildResources location _ = [ { Name = this.Name Location = location Sku = this.Sku AdminUserEnabled = this.AdminUserEnabled } The IBuilder interface has two methods:\n DependencyName - this is the name of the resource. It\u0026rsquo;s used by Farmer when setting dependencies between multiple resources. BuildResources - this functions takes in two arguments: the location the resources should be deployed to, and a list of any existing resources that have been created so far. Normally, you can ignore the second argument. The method should return the list of IArmResource resources that must be created - as you can see, this is a relatively simple mapping. For more complex builders e.g. one which represent multiple IArmResources at once, your BuildResources function will emit a list of IArmResources.   It\u0026rsquo;s tempting to suggest simply applying IBuilder directly onto the IArmResource. You could probably do this, but the separation and clarity provided here is an important step, and gives freedom in the future to diverge the shapes of the builder and the resource.\n Step 3.2 Test out the IBuilder. You can finish this exercise by confirming that your IBuilder works correctly:\nopen Farmer.Builders.ContainerRegistry let registries = { Name = ResourceName \u0026#34;my-registry\u0026#34; Sku = ContainerRegistry.Basic AdminUserEnabled = true } let deployment = arm { location Location.WestEurope add_resource registries } deployment |\u0026gt; Writer.quickWrite \u0026#34;output\u0026#34;  Ensure that the location of WestEurope has been correctly applied to the emitted ARM template json file!\n "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/cdn/","title":"CDN","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The CDN builder is used to create Azure Content Delivery Network instances.\n CDN Profile (Microsoft.Cdn/profiles) CDN Endpoint (Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/endpoints) CDN Custom Domain (Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/endpoints/customDomains)  There are two builders available:\n The CDN builder, which maps to a CDN profile.

Providing Builder syntax","tags":[],"description":"","content":"If you want to get the nice json-like syntax for your configuration record, you need to implement a separate class which contains a set of methods that act on the Configuration Record that you created previously - one for each keyword that you want.\n If you need have not built your own computation expression before, here are some resources to brush up:\n Office microsoft docs The \u0026ldquo;Computation Expressions\u0026rdquo; series Workshop   Step 4.1: Creating basic keywords We will not cover the inner details of creating a CE here. But to get started the only member you need to implement id Yield, which returns a minimal implementation of your resource.\n// Builder.ContainerRegistry.fs type ContainerRegistryBuilder() = /// Required - creates default \u0026#34;starting\u0026#34; values  member _.Yield _ = { Name = ResourceName.Empty Sku = Basic AdminUserEnabled = false } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Sets the name of the Azure Container Registry instance.  member _.Name (state:ContainerRegistryConfig, name) = { state with Name = ResourceName name } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;sku\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Sets the name of the SKU/Tier for the Container Registry instance.  member _.Sku (state:ContainerRegistryConfig, sku) = { state with Sku = sku } [\u0026lt;CustomOperation \u0026#34;enable_admin_user\u0026#34;\u0026gt;] /// Enables the admin user on the Azure Container Registry.  member _.EnableAdminUser (state:ContainerRegistryConfig) = { state with AdminUserEnabled = true } let containerRegistry = ContainerRegistryBuilder() Each keyword has a similar set of steps required:\n Create a member which takes in at least one argument, the current state object. The implement should perform some modification and return back the newly-updated state. Decorate the method with the CustomOperation attribute; the string value passed to it will become the keyword name. Use _ to separate words of the keyword e.g. enable_admin_user. Put a /// comment on the method for intellisense to guide users.  Now you can create members on the builder that appear as custom operators in your resource CE. In each member you build up the state of the resource configuration you created in the previous step.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to assign an instance of the builder to a value so it is available for consumers!\n Parameterless keywords You can create parameterless keywords by simply only taking in the state argument e.g. enable_admin_user above.\nKeywords with multiple arguments You can take in multiple arguments by simply putting a comma after each additional argument. They will be consumed by the user with spaces.\nOverloaded keywords You can provide multiple overloads for a keyword. However, each overload must take in the same number of arguments. Do not re-apply the CustomOperation attribute - simply provide multiple methods with the same name.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/container-group/","title":"Container Group","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The Container Group builder is used to create Azure Container Group instances.\n Container Group (Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups)  Builder Keywords | Applies To | Keyword | Purpose | |-|-| | containerInstance | name | Sets the name of the Container Group instance. | | containerInstance | image | Sets the container image. | | containerInstance | add_ports | Sets the ports the container exposes. | | containerInstance | cpu_cores | Sets the maximum CPU cores the container may use. | | containerInstance | memory | Sets the maximum gigabytes of memory the container may use. | | containerInstance | env_vars | Sets a list of environment variables for the container. | | containerInstance | add_volume_mount | Adds a volume mount on a container from a volume in the container group. | | containerGroup | add_instances | Adds container instances to the group. | | containerGroup | os_type | Sets the OS type (default Linux). | | containerGroup | restart_policy | Sets the restart policy (default Always) | | containerGroup | public_dns | Sets the DNS host label when using a public IP. | | containerGroup | private_ip | Indicates the container should use a system-assigned private IP address for use in a virtual network. | | containerGroup | network_profile | Name of a network profile resource for the subnet in a virtual network where the container group will attach. | | containerGroup | add_tcp_port | Adds a TCP port to be externally accessible. | | containerGroup | add_udp_port | Adds a UDP port to be externally accessible. | | containerGroup | add_volumes | Adds volumes to a container group so they are accessible to containers. |\nExample open Farmer open Farmer.Builders open Farmer.ContainerGroup let nginx = containerInstance { name \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;nginx:1.17.6-alpine\u0026#34; add_ports PublicPort [ 80us; 443us ] add_ports InternalPort [ 9090us; ] memory 0.5\u0026lt;Gb\u0026gt; cpu_cores 1 env_vars [ env_var \u0026#34;CONTENT_PATH\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/www\u0026#34; secure_env_var \u0026#34;SECRET_PASSWORD\u0026#34; \u0026#34;shhhhhh!\u0026#34; ] add_volume_mount \u0026#34;secret-files\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/config/secrets\u0026#34; add_volume_mount \u0026#34;source-code\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/src/farmer\u0026#34; } let group = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;webApp\u0026#34; operating_system Linux restart_policy AlwaysRestart add_udp_port 123us add_instances [ nginx ] add_volumes [ volume_mount.secret_string \u0026#34;secret-files\u0026#34; \u0026#34;secret1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;abcdefg\u0026#34; volume_mount.git_repo \u0026#34;source-code\u0026#34; (Uri \u0026#34;https://github.com/CompositionalIT/farmer\u0026#34;) ] } Private Virtual Network Example Attaching a container group to a virtual network requires adding a service delegation on a subnet indicating it is for container groups, adding a network profile to bind the container group interface to that subnet, and finally adding the container group itself with a private IP address.\nopen Farmer open Farmer.Builders let privateNetwork = vnet { name \u0026#34;private-vnet\u0026#34; add_address_spaces [ \u0026#34;10.30.0.0/16\u0026#34; ] add_subnets [ subnet { name \u0026#34;ContainerSubnet\u0026#34; prefix \u0026#34;10.30.19.0/24\u0026#34; add_delegations [ SubnetDelegationService.ContainerGroups ] } ] } let aciProfile = networkProfile { name \u0026#34;vnet-aci-profile\u0026#34; vnet \u0026#34;private-vnet\u0026#34; subnet \u0026#34;ContainerSubnet\u0026#34; } let myContainer = container { name \u0026#34;helloworld\u0026#34; image \u0026#34;microsoft/aci-helloworld\u0026#34; add_ports PublicPort [ 80us ] } let group = containerGroup { name \u0026#34;webApp\u0026#34; operating_system Linux restart_policy AlwaysRestart add_instances [ myContainer ] network_profile \u0026#34;vnet-aci-profile\u0026#34; private_ip [TCP, 80us] } "},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/contributing/adding-resources/5-unit-testing/","title":"5.

The team will be happy to support you getting your feature over the line.\nThese are the following checks we\u0026rsquo;ll normally put in place:\n1. Create an issue first! Except for small pull requests, create an issue to discuss the feature. The last thing we want is for someone to spend hours of their time on a feature only for someone else to have started work on something similar, or for the admins of the project to reject it for whatever reason e.g. does not fit with the project etc. Creating an issue does not take long and will help save time for everyone.\n2. Create Documentation Every PR to Farmer must have some documentation with it. If you modify a resource and add a new keyword, it must be added to the appropriate docs page.\n3. Write Unit Tests Every PR to Farmer should have at least one test associated with it. If no tests are added, you can expect at least a request for one or explanation as to why one is not necessary.\n4. Write Release Notes Every PR to Farmer must include an entry to the RELEASE_NOTES.md file under the next release. Briefly explain the feature and ideally link to the PR number e.g.\n5.

You\u0026rsquo;ll create Farmer applications which use a simple F# SDK to interact with Azure; Farmer will create ARM templates in the background for you transparently, so you\u0026rsquo;ll never see or interact with them.\nIn such a case, you can opt to deploy directly through Farmer. This mode provides an F# wrapper around the Azure CLI which captures your credentials during the deployment process.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking to stay within F# and e.g. respond to outcomes from the deployment such as using deployment outputs, this is an excellent option because Farmer is just a dotnet application and the deployment call is a simple function call.\nAnother benefit of this is because Farmer is a simple .NET Standard library, you can use it natively within .NET build tools such as FAKE or CAKE.\nCombined Resource and Application Deployment Farmer can also optionally do more for you by handling the entire deployment process, including deployment of your application artifacts.\ngraph LR subgraph Azure Resource Group D(Azure App Service) end subgraph JSON C(ARM Template) -- REST API or Azure CLI -- D end subgraph .NET A(Farmer)-- resources emitted to -- C A -. your application deployed via ZIP Deploy.- D end  Watch this short video to see more!\n  Option 2: \u0026ldquo;I already have an ARM deployment strategy\u0026rdquo; If you already use ARM templates, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably already have a strategy for working with templates and deploying them to Azure, such as PowerShell, the Azure CLI or a build system such as Azure DevOps or Octopus Deploy.

In this case, Farmer itself won\u0026rsquo;t be a part of your build / deploy chain, which will remain the same as today - you\u0026rsquo;ll use Farmer just as an edit-time task to create an ARM template itself which you will then manually modify.\nThe choice is yours.\nHow do I create a Service Principal?

I like the look of this - how do I \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo; it?  Create an ARM template using the Farmer sample app. Follow the steps here to deploy the generated template into Azure. Log any issues or ideas that you find here.  How do I get Farmer to work from a continuous deployment (CD) process?  Look at some of the alternative strategies outlined here. Read up on ARM deployment strategies e.g. Azure Devops have guides here.  The Farmer .NET Template also has support for creating a Azure Devops-ready application from scratch.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know F#. Would you consider writing a C# version of this? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid not. F# isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to learn (especially for simple DSLs such as this), and you can easily integrate F# applications as part of a dotnet solution, since F# is a first-class citizen of the dotnet core ecosystem. You can even create new resources in C# since the core abstractions of Farmer are two simple .NET interfaces.\nAre you trying to replace ARM templates? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer generates ARM templates that can be used just as normal; Farmer can also be used simplify to make the process of getting started much simpler, or incorporated into your build pipeline as a way to avoid managing difficult-to-manage ARM templates and instead use them as the final part of your build / release pipeline.\nAre you trying to compete with Pulumi? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer has (at least currently) a specific goal in mind, which is to lower the barrier to entry for creating and working with ARM templates that are non-complex. We\u0026rsquo;re not looking to create a cross-platform DSL to also support things like Terraform etc. or provide a stateful service store that Pulumi offers. Instead, Farmer is a simple way to continue to use ARM templates today but benefit from a more rapid authoring and maintenance process.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no support for variables or parameters! Farmer intentionally has limited support for ARM parameters and variables. Read here to find out the alternatives.\nCan I add resources that are not supported by Farmer? Yes. You can use some adapters that Farmer provides to generate resources using basic .NET objects, or even paste ARM template JSON directly into Farmer and have that embedded inside. See the following links from the Contributing section:\n Using raw JSON with Resource.ofJSON Using anonymous records or objects with Resource.ofObj Using the IArmResource interface.  The resource I need isn\u0026rsquo;t included! Create an issue on our github repository, ideally with a sample ARM template and a link to the official Microsoft documentation on the resource. We can\u0026rsquo;t promise we\u0026rsquo;ll look at it immediately, but raising the issue is an important first step to getting more resources supported.\nBut our organisation really needs that resource enhancement today! Drop us an email explaining what you need; we\u0026rsquo;re happy to discuss a commercial support arrangement to provide you with features that you need in a more timely fashion.\n"},{"uri":"https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/api-overview/resources/event-grid/","title":"Event Grid","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Overview The Event Grid is a simple but powerful builder that links events from Azure services such as Storage and App Service to one or many subscribers which can consume the events.

We\u0026rsquo;ll create a basic resource that can hook into the Farmer pipeline, by adding support to Farmer for the ContainerRegistry Azure resource. This will involve:\n Defining an type that implements IArmResource that maps directly to the ARM template output. Defining any domain types required to capture details on the resource. Defining a type that implements IBuilder and an associated computation expression that will be easier for users to consume than an F# record.  This will end up allowing us to define a resource that looks like this:\nlet myRegistry = containerRegistry { name \u0026#34;devonRegistry\u0026#34; sku ContainerRegistrySku.Basic enable_admin_user } let deployment = arm { location NorthEurope add_resource myRegistry } which generates JSON looking something like this:\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;devonRegistry\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;northeurope\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;sku\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Basic\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;adminUserEnabled\u0026#34;: true, }, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [] } Useful terminology  Resource: A resource is a single Azure service provided by ARM; in Farmer these resource models are created by implementing the IArmResource interface.

Deployment: Represents the deployment of an ARM template to a specific Location and Resource Group name. Builder: In Farmer, an IBuilder represents provides the capability of creating a smart type that helps model a resource or a collection of resources into associated IArmResource objects required for constructing the ARM template.

The value will be stored in KeyVault and the system identity will be activated and provided into the KeyVault with GET permissions. Lastly, Web App app settings will remain in place, using the Azure App Service built-in KeyVault redirection capabilities.\nThe following keywords exist on the web app:\n   Member Purpose     use_keyvault Tells the web app to create a brand new KeyVault for this App Service\u0026rsquo;s secrets.   use_managed_keyvault Tells the web app to use an existing Farmer-managed KeyVault which you have defined elsewhere.   use_external_keyvault Tells the web app to use an existing non-Farmer managed KeyVault which you have defined elsewhere.

Farmer is an easy-to-learn library for rapidly authoring and deploying entire Azure architectures.\n Infrastructure-as-code, done right. Simple code snippets allow you to rapidly construct complex topologies. Idempotent deployments. Safely provision a template repeatedly and know that only changes will be applied. Cross-platform. Runs on .NET Core on Windows, Mac or Linux. Built on trusted technologies. Farmer uses Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure Resource Manager (ARM) technology for deployments to Azure. Commercial supported. Professional support plans for teams that wish to benefit from peace of mind and further improve the product. Easy to learn, easy to understand code through a simple, strongly-typed and pragmatic DSL.  Already using ARM templates? Farmer has you covered.\n Farmer is completely backwards compatible with ARM templates. Farmer generates standard ARM templates so you can continue to use existing deployment processes. Safely create dependencies between resources. Uses static typing to give confidence that your templates will work first time. Easily access common properties of resources. No more fighting to concatenate cryptic strings! Extensible API. Add new helpers and members as needed. Open source and free. Farmer is free to use and modify. We welcome contributions to the project!  Why not Azure Resource Manager? Farmer uses a simple DSL to declare resources and comes with helper functions to perform common tasks. Farmer templates are around 5-8 times smaller than ARM templates, meaning they are quicker and easier to author, understand and maintain.
